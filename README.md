BlockSHK Vendor Application is an innovative solution designed to enable software vendors to create and deploy software licenses securely using blockchain technology. The application uses smart contracts, ensuring that licenses are immutable, transparent, and protected from duplication.

The application boasts an intuitive user interface, which means even non-technical users can easily harness the power of blockchain for license management.
